empathy
=======

Empathy is a distributed environment for the generation of emotions and other related affective phenomena like moods and temperaments. Empathy has been conceived as an object-oriented reusable framework entirely written in Java and realized for the purpose of studying the direct influences of emotions on behaviors and on decision-making processes of autonomous agents, interacting in complex or real environments. It allows for the realization of custom emotional agents, usable in several different domains, from the educational applications (e.g. entertainment, video games, intelligent tutoring systems.) to control systems in autonomous robots
